Type these commands directly into bash (your terminal, shell, command line interpreter, whatever you want to call it [tested in bash, sh, and zsh *ymmv])

cd git

<p>/*
 Ok so that was git in 60 seconds.  What just went on?  Let me be abit more verbose with an intro of some very basic commands with a basic explanation after the <code>&lt;--</code> :
*/</p>

<pre><code>pwd      &lt;-- Print Working Directory (the "you are here" of unix land)
mkdir    &lt;-- make directory/folder
cd       &lt;-- change directory (this is how you 'move' around the file system
ls       &lt;-- list the current directory i.e. show me what is in the current folder
man      &lt;-- “manual” gives the manual page for any command i.e. `man ls` will give the manual page for ls
man git  &lt;-- At some point you'll feel confident enough to just pull this page up for reference, not just yet
</code></pre>

<pre><code># This is a comment, lines that start with a hash are comments and
# and are ways for me to explain what is going on for your benefit only 
# comments are  very important in programming languages

# ok from here $ means the prompt
# and you should type what directly follows that $ into your command prompt
# like learning a new language it's best for you to actually speak (type) the words
# and see the resulting output, it's very satisfying to see your creation take life
# let's see those first commands again with some # comments to explain what's going on

$ pwd
# pwd should print the path to your home directory at the moment
# by default this is where you usually start when opening a shell
$ cd /tmp
# change directory to /tmp
# /tmp is a great place for temporary stuff, careful this place is erased upon reboot
$ pwd
# prove to me that we changed directories (i.e. it should now print /tmp)
$ mkdir git
# make a new directory named ‘git’
$ cd git
# change into the git directory
$ pwd
# now displays /tmp/git
$ git init
# initialize /tmp/git into a git repo
$ echo 'my test' &gt;test1
# overwrite or make a new file called test1 and makes its contents read ‘my test’
$ ls
# show me this new file
$ cat test1
# dumps the contents of the file which should be ‘my test’
$ git status
# have git tell us of any changes in the current directory
$ git add test1
# add our new file to gits tracking system
$ git status
# show us that the new file has now been added
$ git commit -am 'initial add of test1'
# make a commit and give it a nice message explaining what is going on
$ git log
# show us a log of the history of this git repo
$ echo 'second test' &gt;&gt;test1
# make a second line in our first test file
$ git status
$ echo 'second test file'&gt;test2
# make a second test file
$ git status
# show us which files have changed
$ git diff
# show us the changes
$ git commit -am 'second test'
# commit those changes
$ git log
# show us a log of the history of this git repo
